## Introduction

- C is a compiled and general-purpose programming language, closely associated with the Unix system
- the language is not tied to any one operating system or machine
- useful for writing compilers and operating system, but also to write major programs in many different domains
- C provides a variety of data types, the fundamental ones are characters, integers and floats
- in addition, there is a hierarchy of types created with pointers, array, structures and unions
- expressions are formed from operators and operands, any expression can be a statement
- provides the fundamental control flow constructions like statement grouping, decision-making (if/else, switch), looping (for, while, do) and early loop exit (break)
- provides no operations to deal directly with composites such as strings, sets, lists or arrays
- no heap or garbage collection
- no I/O facilities and no file access methods
- offers only straightforward, single-threaded control flows
- not strongly-typed, but its type checking has been strengthened
