## Irrational Numbers

- rational: any number that can be expressed as the ratio (!) or fraction p/q of two integers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
- irrational: every other number

- multiplying two rational numbers: rational

  - (a / b) \* (m / n) = am / bn
  - integer \* integer => integer
  - integer / integer => rational

- adding two rational numbers: rational

  - (a / b) + (m / n) = (an + bm) / bn
  - integer \* integer => integer
  - integer + integer => integer
  - integer / integer => rational

- multiplying rational & irrational number: irrational

  - proof by contradiction: rational \* irrational => rational
  - (a / b) \* x = m / n
  - x = (mb / na)
    => x = integer / integer
    => x = rational
    => x => rational, but originally irrational

- adding rational & irrational number: irrational

  - proof by contradiction: rational + irrational => rational
  - (a / b) + x = (m / n)
  - x = (m / n) - (a / b)
  - x = ((mb - na) / nb)
    => x = (integer - integer) / integer
    => x = integer / integer
    => x = rational
    => x => rational, but originally irrational

- adding two irrational numbers: depends on the number

  - Pi + (1 - Pi) = 1
  - irrational + irrational = rational

  - Pi + Pi = 2Pi
  - irrational + irrational = irrational

- multiplying two irrational numbers: depends on the number

  - sqrt2 \* sqrt2 = 2
  - irrational \* irrational = rational

  - Pi \* Pi = Pi^2
  - irrational \* irrational = irrational
