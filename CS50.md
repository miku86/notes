## Binary, C

* it's about Problem Solving
* Programming is a tool for Problem Solving
* Input => Algorithms => Output

* Decimal System: `101 => 1*100 + 0*10 + 1*1 = 101`
* Binary System: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5` (in decimal)

* Transistors On/Off for Binary System
* Mapping: ASCII for Letters => Unicode

* Algorithms: Recipes to do something
* first write in Pseudocode
* later translate into real code

* Source Code => Compiler => Machine Code

* use the Debugger!

## Algorithms, Memory

* Plaintext + Key => Ciphertext
* Ciphertext + Key => Plaintext

* Memory = like Lockers => PC has to look into it first
* sorted vs. unsorted

* Big O Notation:

  * constant: c
  * logarithmic: log n - binary search in sorted list
  * linear: n - linear search
  * linearithmic: n log n - merge sort
  * quadratic: n^2 - bubble, selection, insert sort
  * exponential: c^n - travelling salesman (dynamic programming)
  * factorial: n! - travelling salesman (brute force)

* Linear Search: one for one, from left to right: O(n)
* Binary Search: search in the middle, half it every time: O(log n)

* Insertion Sort: insert into right spot on sorted side
* Selection Sort: select the smallest number
* Bubble Sort: bubbling highest number up: O(n^2)

* Merge Sort: Left Half, Right Half, Merge: O(n log n)
* Recursion: Function calls itself until basecase

* Heap, Stack
* Garbage Values: old functions from the Stack
* Pointer, Pointee, Assignment
* `char *`, `malloc`

* Hexadecimal: 0-f, 2 blocks of 2^4 bits
  => decimal: 255
  => binary: 1111 1111
  => hexa: 0x ff

## Data Structures

* struct to create new data structure
* Linked List for dynamic memory allocation
* Stack: LIFO
* Queue: FIFO
* Tree
* Hash Table: Array with Linked List
* Trie: constant time

## HTTP

* set of conventions for communication
* Routing, TCP, IP
* Server: piece of software, that listens for http requests and responds to them
* `192.168.2.1:80` => IP and TCP Port

## Python

* Source Code => Compiler => Byte Code => Interpreter
* named paramters/arguments
* no more pointers
* for in loop
* Flask as web microframework
