## Introduction to Cyber Security

- CIA-Triad:
  - Confidentiality: prevent unauthorized disclosure of information
  - Integrity: prevent unauthorized modification of information
  - Availability: ensure timely access to information

## Protect the Facility

- safety of our employees is #1
- attackers can use physical attack to lower defense (fire alarm)
- physical access can lead to theft
- "I notice you don't have your badge with you. I'll walk you to the security to get you a temporary one."

## Protect the Network

Threats:

- network attacks are the most common technical threat to a network
- can reach from eavesdropping to DoS
- can cause compliance and regulatory issues
- can lead to compromise of customer data resulting in loss of revenue and law suits
- our system can be used to attack others

Solutions:

- protect physical access to systems
- secure protocols when transmitting data (HTTPS)
- encrypt emails and files
- download from trusted sites
- scan all downloaded files
- don't bring media to work without prior approval
- dont' connect systems to the network without approval

## Protect Yourself and Your Information

Threats:

- protect PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Full Name, SSN, Address, Phone Number, Biometrics

Solutions:

- hide these informations, don't carry them around in your wallet
- store personal information in a safe place at home
- shred receipts, credit offers, account statements, expired cards => dumpster divers
- don't trade these information for "goodies"
- don't respond to requests by phone, mail or online
- use firewall and anti-virus software

## Social Engineering â€“ The Greatest Threat: Trust

Threats:

- Phishing: mails usually appear to come from a well-known organization and ask for your personal information
- Pretexting: mail from someone saying that a maintenance worker will be swinging by and needs access to your rooms
- Baiting: giving some information and provoking action
- Quid Pro Quo: if you give me your information, I will give you full credit
- Tailgating: a person impersonates a delivery driver and wait outside a building. When an employee goes in, the attacker asks that the employee "hold the door", thereby gaining access through someone who is authorized to enter the company.

Solutions:

- trust no one!
- require multifactor authentication
- don't succumb to pressure
- don't leave valuable information on your desk
- don't leave your pc unlocked (`super/win + L`)

## Email

Threats:

- through email attachments with malicious code

Solutions:

- never read unexpected mails from unknown senders
- never click links of unexpected mails
- never download unexpected files
- watch for poor grammar, misspellings, "urgent" or "money" messages

## How to Defend Against Malicious Websites

Threats:

- Browser Hijacking: site doesn't let you leave the site (alerts, popups)
- "Scanned your pc and found virus!"-sites
- "Free Downloads!"-sites

Solutions:

- avoid such sites
- know how to handle Browser Hijacking: `Cmd + W`, Task Manager/System Monitor
- don't run your pc as admin/root
- use HTTPS
- backup your data

## How to Protect your Mobile Device

- don't give other people physical access (reading data, installing apps)
- don't login into unknown networks (free wifis...)
- don't accept sharing your information with an app (location, contacts)
- turn off unused connections (mobile data, wifi, bluetooth, gps)

- backup data
- watch what you share
- don't give other people physical access (reading data, installing apps)
