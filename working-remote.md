# Working Remote

## Proving yourself

So you've gotten approval to work remotely. This is a huge victory and the first real step towards remote life.

You're goal now is to spend the next month or so proving that:

- You're more productive working from home
- You're just as available as when you're in the office
- You can do this by being overly communicative when at home. Send an end of day recap on days you work remotely. Be active in the group chat.

During your 1:1s with your manager, explain how working from home has really benefitted the project, with specific references to how the extended focus time has helped you solve problems you wouldn't have been able to in the office.

Also, ask for feedback from the team about the state of things. At this point, they probably won't have much feedback, since it's not much of a change for them, but it's going to be important going forward to have this line of communication open.

Show how the change hasn't impacted anything, and has likely improved work. Mention how you'd really like to try more days, to see if you can further benefit from the focused time.

## Managing Communication

You're spending the majority of the time away from your team, and it's going to increase the likelihood that they need to get in touch but aren't sure how.

To avoid this situation, become even more proactive about communication. You can start by taking some small steps to let folks know you're still around.

If you don't have a daily stand-up, be sure to send daily status via chat/email

If possible, be sure to always turn on your video during meetings. It's much easier for people to remember you're in the meeting if they can see your face, instead of looking at some weird speaker phone thing.

Use you chat status to communicate passively, always updating it with what you're working on at the moment.

## Having an on-site ally

Even with you doing your best to stay in touch, it's going to be difficult.

Speakerphones will break, the audio quality is going to likely suck, and video connections in conference rooms will be spotty.

People may be patient with this at first, but after the fifth time in a row of a meeting starting late because of connection issues, they're going to start blaming you for not just showing up to the office like everyone else.

This is where an on-site ally can do wonders.

Someone to help pre-check the AV connections before the meetings, to help troubleshoot communication issues when they come up, and to remember to say bye at the end of the meeting so you're not sitting there at home wondering if the meeting ended or you lost your audio connection.

As important as it is to be a good remote worker, it's equally important to have good "remote" teammates.

Without them, you're going to be trying to steer a battleship with a paddle. It's never going to work and you're going to look like a fool for trying.

## Managing your day

Aside from the tools, you'll also need some techniques for staying productive over the long run.

It's easy to be productive from home one day a week, but once the novelty wears off, you can start slacking and fall behind.

### Starting the day

One of the best tricks I know is to leave a problem unsolved for you to finish in the morning. When ending the work day, don't try and finish that last task. Leave a small final step for you to complete in the morning, giving you a good starting point in the morning.

### Take real breaks

One hidden difficulty of remote working is knowing how-to and when to take breaks, and for how long.

In the office, these breaks are inherently encouraged by colleagues wanting to grab coffee or go see that new weird art piece in the lobby.

At home, no one is going to stop by, so you need to learn to take breaks yourself.

Here is my "ideal" plan:

- 15 minute morning break
- 1 hour lunch
- 30 minute afternoon break

These breaks are going to be really important to keep you from burning out on screens. Without the commute to the office and the lunchtime chatter, you're going to start losing touch with the outside world.

Allow yourself the chance to make a coffee run, or spend some time outside in the garden. It's going to keep you productive over the long run.

Also, don't spend your breaks checking twitter or doing some sort of screen related thing. Give your eyes a break and get outside.

## Creating Keyword Job List Emails

In my most recent search for remote contract work, I tried out a new tactic that ended up landing me a couple interviews and a contract offer. Huge job boards like indeed.com are a little old-school and don't typically have a lot of remote postings. However, they do offer the ability to setup daily email notifications that include lists of postings that match a search criteria. So what I did was setup one of these emails using some keywords related to my career and included the word "remote". This doesn't guarantee that you only get remote positions though, so be careful when applying for positions from these sites, as some of them might not actually be remote friendly.

## LinkedIn Recruiters

Let the recruiters know right out the gate that you're only interested in remote positions. Good recruiters will work with you to find positions that fit your requirements, when they come up. It's also a good idea to let the recruiter know things like your hours of availability, and salary expectations or contract rates. The more specific you can be, the more likely the recruiter is to come to you with tangible leads instead of random crap.

## Slack Communities

As it turns out, other Software Developers are a great resource for finding available jobs. By the nature of their career, have direct access to businesses that utilize Software Development services.

There are thousands of Slack communities available out there, including local ones. A lot of these communities have a jobs channel where people post available positions and contracts that they've run into. These communities are absolute gold when you're looking for remote work, because Slack communities, by their very nature, attract more modern thinking individuals. As an added bonus, Slack communities are a great way for you to network with others in the industry. Even if you don't find a job, you might make some great friends!

## How to Get a Remote Job, Even When Remote Isn’t Advertised

Step 1) Email Outreach. Find a job you’re interested in? Remote isn’t listed as an option? Do your best to find the hiring manager or at least an engineer on the team. Use LinkedIn to find their profiles, use Email Hunter to find their email addresses ( https://hunter.io/ ).

Step 2) Mitigate risk for both sides. Using the found email(s) above, send an initial contact email to the hiring manager/engineer. Put your best foot forward; tell them that you’re interested in the job, that you’ve always loved biotech/non-profits/web development/whatever is specific to the company. Send your resume and Github link right away, don’t make them ask for it.

Tell them upfront that you’re willing to go through their technical screening process. And if you pass their tests, that you’re willing to do a two month contract to make sure “we’re a good fit for each other”. Tell them that during that trial period if it’s all working out well, you’re willing to fly out and meet the team. Tell them all of this in your first initial outreach email.

Most managers have a panic if they have to manage a remote worker (especially if they’ve never done it before). You should be thinking to yourself:

- How do I put their mind at ease? Lower their risk via a short term contract
- How do I gain the team’s trust? Commit consistent, trustworthy code during your trial contract period

Flying out to meet the team. Offering this sends the signal that you’re willing to put in the effort to make this arrangement work. If you really want to be aggressive about getting the job, tell them that you’re willing to pay for the flight and lodging (just make sure you account for this expense by increasing your rate). If things are going well late into the contract, it’s a no-brainer to risk the cost of a flight and hotel to further your chances of obtaining a full-time job. Make sure you book your flight with Southwest — if the contract suddenly goes south at least you can cancel your travel plans and use the credits later on.

Side Note: DO NOT go through their established hiring process. If the first person that you talk to on the phone from the company is from their HR department, you’re doing it wrong!
Do the footwork. Zero in on the best manager/engineer to pitch to. Fire your best shot (email).
