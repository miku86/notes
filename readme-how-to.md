# Writing README Files

[Source](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud777)

## Why

Anybody who uses your code is going to be needing to use documentation. That might be you, your coworkers, or your users!
If you don't provide documentation, readers will have to skim to your code to understand your thoughts.
Better read them down!

For small projects, write a `README.md` with (Github) Markdown.

## Markdown Syntax:

```
# Heading
`code`
**strong**
_emphasized_
[link name](link url)
```

## Anatomy of a README

Table of Content, Usage, Contributing, FAQ can be optional, if your Project is really small.
