# Early Retirement Extreme

Financial independence advice boils down to increasing income and decreasing expenses.
Most advice is heavily weighted on increasing income.
This book tips the scale on reducing expenses.

# A Different Frame of Mind

Fisker starts with an allegory of Plato's Cave.
In this cave, prisoners have been arranged in a row since childhood.
They have neck braces, so they can only look forward.
Behind them is a fire, so they can see their own shadows on the wall.
The prisoner's world is just shadows - they think they are the shadows and their friends are shadows.
One prisoner breaks free and sees the world outside.
He comes back and tries to convince his friends to join him.
He tells them there's more to the world than just shadows.
These prisoners have a hard time believing him and prefer to stay where they are.

# The Lock In

Life in the 1st world countries have become like Plato's Cave.
Everyone is expected to go to school, get a degree, work 9-5 to afford a mortgage & consume, then retire at an old age.
Fisker argues that a lot of effort goes into spending money.
Spending becomes a reward for your hard work.
On top of it, the harder you work the more you're taxed.
Society has encouraged us to become specialists - locking us into a specific job.
While being a generalist is useful, it doesn't fit well into the existing system. We're just cogs in one giant machine.
Unfortunately, we're such efficient cogs that our production is amazing.
With large production comes large marketing and large consuming.

We have a choice to stop over-consuming.
If you stop, you can afford to retire at a much earlier age.
Fisker managed to drop his expenses to 10k-12k/year.
After 5 years of work as a post-doc, he saved enough money to retire.

Fisker presents three pillars:

- Reduce waste and increase efficiency. This lets you live with the same benefits while eliminating spending.
- Have significantly reduced expenses and invest the difference in production.
- Find something meaningful to do besides work.

# Economic Degrees of Freedom

A society that worships conformity has zero apparent degrees of freedom.

    +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
    |           | tight       | loose           | // coupling
    +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
    | linear    | salary man  | working man     |
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+
    | nonlinear | businessman | renaissance man |
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+
      // organization

Coupling is a measure of a person's dependence on the world.
Linearity limits degrees of freedom because of its dependence on steps. A business that sells widgets A and B is less likely to fail than a business that sells widget A and A-extender.

Salary men are specialized wage earners who earn money from one source. They are very dependent on the company they work for. They have very little control over their careers.
The working man doesn't collect a salary, his income is uncertain. He usually has an emergency fund. The consumer pattern is still similar to a salary man.
The business man also has unreliable income - but is very dependent to his customers and business. He can't just take off at the spur-of-a-moment for a vacation.
The renaissance man has a generalized skill set and multiple sources of income. The income may be unreliable, but he's not dependent on a company or customers.

# The Renaissance Ideal

A renaissance man is also known as a universal man, polymath, or jack of all trades.
When the term first came into existence, human knowledge was still relatively small so a dedicated person could eventually master different fields of knowledge.
Thanks to an immense amount of effort spent on research, it's hard to master even one field.
Instead, Fisker argues we should try to become competent in a range of fields.
Try to constantly improve what you know and explore new useful areas.

The fields a person should focus fall into seven groups:

- physiological => obtain optimal levels of physical/mental health, know about healthy diets/exercises and maintain them, basic first aid and other emergency knowledge
- economical => learn basics of economics, finance, investing, balancing books
- intellectual => learn to learn, critical analyzing, research skills
- emotional => not waste resources, appraise value, strong character
- social => get to know people outside of profession, learn to sell, network, and politics
- technical => knowledge of services are useful to save money, working understanding of technologies, learn common trades
- ecological => food, growing food, cooking, etc...

# Strategy, Tactics, and Guiding Principles

When you're learning new skills, it's important to have these goals:

- become less dependent on a single source of income
- become less dependent on a multitude of store services

Here's a short list of suggestions:

- hair cutting
- mending clothes
- cooking
- trading (buying used or swapping)
- public transportation instead of car
- borrow from library instead of purchasing books
- gardening for food
- making simple, non-toxic household agents
- bicycle, motorcycle, or car maintenance

Learning via projects is a great way to start. Just avoid projects that cost money.
It's best to work on projects that earn money or projects that are "free" or save money.

# A Renaissance Lifestyle

Some guidelines:

- reduce wants/needs from marketplace to minimum
- decrease volume/size but increase sophistication of activities/possessions
- measure prosperity by less activity (do fewer useless things)
- work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years
- avoid generating waste
- use system in your advantage (don't be evil!)
- serve yourself instead of having others serve you
- keep running costs low but pay for value
- maintain health
- build up capital to live as a capitalist
- always have the skills to find a new job just in case
- focus on developing skills rather than passive entertainment
- gain maximum in satisfaction with minimum expenditure of money/energy

## Things

They cost money, take up space, require maintenance, and are hard to get rid of.
Own things that are **needed**, durable, and preferably small.
Things usually depreciate over time, take this into account.
Don't give into buying things you want for pure entertainment - make sure you really need it.
Avoid getting new things unless required and get rid of existing things unless required.

## Shelter

The two most important qualities of shelter are location and price.
It must be close to your job (if you're working) and a grocery store.
Preferably within walking distance so you can give up a car.
It must be cheap.

## Clothes

Get durable clothes that's flexible for all occasions.
Dress more compatible with the weather to save money on trying to change with the temperature.
Learn to mend your clothes.
Make your own detergent.

## Health

Health is the wealth that matters the most.
Stay active and fit.
Have a high deductible, low premium health insurance plan and stay fit so we'll only use it for emergencies. F
Intermittent fasting prolongs your life.
Learn to cook your own food. Learn which meals can be made cheap and healthy. Optimize your ingredients.

## Transportation

Minimize the distance you need to travel.
Cars should be for recreational use.
Use them on weekends for tours and use your feet for weekdays.
If you must have a car, learn how to maintain/repair it yourself.
Cars are depreciating assets, buy one to get your from point A to B (never as a status symbol!)

## Services

What's "necessary" in modern times weren't available just a few decades ago.
Do you really need the TV, cell phone, and other services you pay for? Evaluate them to save some extra money.
Getting rid of TV also has the benefit of getting additional time.
TV prevents people from learning.
Instead, workers just vegetate in front of it after a full day of work.

Some services to think about:

- television
- cell phone
- internet
- credit cards
- insurance (low premium, high deductible for emergencies!)

## People

"If I can't identify with a job title, like assistant sales manager, who am I really?"

Radically changing your lifestyle will get some negative criticisms your way.
Just ignore it.
Don't try to keep up with the jonses.

A lot of people say it'd be easier if they were single.
Technically, it's not true.
It's easier to have two people earning incomes and sharing a household than trying to do it alone!
There's no secret here, just plain old compromise.

# Foundations of Economics and Finance

The wage earner's cash flow looks like this: stuff -> you -> wage (loops back to stuff)

It can be even worse when introducing debt: stuff -> you -> wage -> debt (loops back to stuff)

To become independent, you'll need to develop an emergency fund because income will become unreliable.
You'll also need to spend far less than what you typically spend.

A typical recommended savings rate is 10%. For every 9 years of work, you'll have enough money saved up to cover 1 year of not working.
What if you could save 50%? For every 1 year of work, you can cover 1 year of not working.
Now tip the scale in the other direction - 80% savings rate. For every 2 years of work, you can take 8 years off.
This is how early retirement is reached.

Fisker recommends we learn to invest our money so we can survive on the interest earned from our savings.

When you purchase an item or maintain a monthly/annual expense, try to think of the amount you need saved to cover it.
For example, that daily cup of coffee costs ~40/month or ~480/year. Assuming a very conservative 4% interest from your savings:

    0.04 * X = 480
    X = $12,000

You'll need to save an additional $12,000 for retirement to maintain the $40/mo expense.

# Objections

Objection: You're obviously a talented person and it's a waste not to use that talent.
Answer: Many talented people waste their talents in jobs that serve no purpose other than making useless products intended to end up in a landfill in return for a paycheck in order to buy useless products made by other people doing the same thing.

Objection: Doing everything yourself takes a lot/too much time.
Answer: Shopping and calling service professionals takes a lot/too much time too. It takes equally long time to do something yourself as it does to arrange a purchase of the solution. What does take more time is acquiring the skills to do things yourself. About 300 hours are required to become competent (markedly better than a layman) at a given skill. Considering that the average person wastes 3-5 hours per day watching TV, it is possible to acquire 3-5 skills per year instead of watching TV. Over just a decade, this adds up since skills are not forgotten once learned.

Objection: Living on a low amount of money, e.g. \$7000/year, is not comfortable.
Answer: Looking at it using Maslow's hierarchy of needs starting with shelter/utilities and safety, graduating to friendship, moving on to esteem, and ending with self-actualization, ERE can be very comfortable as it easily provides all of these. However, if comfort is defined as the ability to purchase consumer goods with little regard for the cost, or measuring one's self-esteem through buying/owning such goods, then ERE is not comfortable. The perception of a lack of comfort is thus partially rooted in the consumerist tradition of not thinking about purchases, and living under the assumption that one must buy things in order to solve problems, be entertained, or be comfortable.

Objection: Why not just do something you love [with a passion] for a living?
Answer: The problem is that doing something for a living can make it less enjoyable than doing it because you want to. It's similar to how enjoying an ice cream cone from time to time is a treat, whereas an entire diet consisting of nothing but ice cream would eventually be nauseating. If you're truly able to enjoy the doing same thing for the next 30-50 years however, go ahead. ERE simply provides you the freedom to do something else should you lose your passion.

Objection: I don't see myself living the same way as a poor person.
Answer: What defines living "rich" or "poor" differs with each culture and generation. No universal definition exists for those terms beyond the concept of poverty that refers to meeting your basic needs. If a person can meet their basic needs, any other external standard is culturally defined. Redefine "rich" in non-consumerist terms.

Objection: If you ever need to go back to work you'll have a hard time since your resume and marketable skills will decay.
Answer: ERE frees a person from working endless hours using only one skill, and allows time to learn many skills. More options exist for a person with several marketable skills instead of 10-20 years of experience with only one skill.

Objection: By spending so little, you are hurting the economy and stealing jobs.
Answer: Spending money to purchase items you don't need so someone else can have a job producing those unnecessary items is the equivalent of one person digging a hole so the next person can have a job filling in the hole.

Objection: There's no way I could ever give up my {cable TV/sports car/horses/etc.}
Answer: For every extra $100 you spend per month, you'll either have to find a substitute or save $40,000 extra to cover the expense. There's no way around that.

Objection: I have kids.
Answer: Kids need food, shelter, and adequate clothing. Those items don't add much to household expenses if ERE principles are followed. Other items that are deemed "necessary" are usually culturally defined needs, not actual needs. Study after study shows that kids benefit most from time with their parents (reading, playing games, exercising) more than anything else. Early retirement provides that time.

Objection: Good luck ever finding a mate. Variation: your poor wife!
Answer: Live by example, compromise when necessary, and realize that financial problems cause more than half of all divorces.

# 21 Day Makeover

## Introduction

It is my posit that in 21 days you could be fully underway to retiring from job-income.
I expect it will take about 1 year after that to master the essentials.
And 5 years of sustained effort to reach the goal.

This requires strength of character and deliberate creative action more than it requires tips, talent, or luck. It is, therefore, much like running a marathon.

There will be no cutting back in this program. Instead things will be cut away completely.
It is much easier to deal psychologically with not having access at all compared to having restricted access.
Restricted access only serves as a constant reminder of what you are missing.
No access on the other hand changes your priorities and values and soon those are seen as the ideal state and your previous state is seen as something undesirable.

Attacking full force on several points leads to synergy.
For example, I will be recommending commuting by bicycle. I will also recommend getting in shape to save on heating costs and medical bills.
These two fit together and they will fit with others things. If you do one, you get the others for free.
If you are only willing to do either one but not all, you will still have to spend time on the other one in some form thus wasting effort.
The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.

The goal here is to cut your expense level to <$10,000/year/adult. 
I live on $6000/year/adult.

To make the change, you need to do three things:

1. Start immediately. The “I’ll go on a diet, starting next year” has never worked. Don’t commit on the spur of the moment, but don’t wait until the excitement has gone away either.
2. Make yourself accountable. Different people are motivated by different things. If you honor your word, you can make a public statement.
3. No exceptions! No exceptions! No exceptions! Exceptions are self-destructive in so many ways.
