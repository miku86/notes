## Chapter 1: The Linux Foundation

### Discuss the role of The Linux Foundation

The Linux Foundation is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations, spanning all industry sectors. Its work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every layer of the software stack.

### Describe the three major Linux distribution families

Red Hat Family Systems (including CentOS and Fedora)
SUSE Family Systems (including openSUSE)
Debian Family Systems (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint).

## Chapter 2: Linux Philosophy and Concepts

Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system, with which its creators were well-versed.
Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.
Linux is a fully multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.
Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet, with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualifications for participating.
The Linux community is a far reaching ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users that supports and advances the Linux operating system.

### Define the common terms associated with Linux

Kernel: glue between hardware and applications
Distribution: collection of software, combined with the Linux Kernel, making up a Linux-based Operating System
Bootloader: program that boots the Operating System
Service: program that runs as a background process
Filesystem: method for storing and organizing files
X Window System: graphical subsystem on nearly all Linux systems
Desktop Environment: graphical user interface on top of the OS
Command Line: interface for typing commands on top of the OS
Shell: Command Line Interpreter that interprets the Command Line input and instructs the OS to perform any tasks and command

## Chapter 3: Linux Basics and System Startup

### Identify the differences between partitions and filesystems

A partition is a physically contiguous section of a disk, or what appears to be so.
A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk (usually in a partition).
One can think of a partition as a container in which a filesystem resides, although in some circumstances, a filesystem can span more than one partition if one uses symbolic links, which we will discuss much later.

### Describe the boot process

Power On
BIOS: Initialize hardware, test memory
MBR: boot loader is stored in boot sector or efi partition
Boot Loader: load kernel image and initial Ram Disk
Kernel: initialize and configure memory and all hardware
Initial Ram Disk: load filesystem, drivers
sbin/init (systemd now): init program of root filesystem
Command Shell using getty: User Login
X Windows System
