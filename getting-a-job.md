# Getting a Job

Create a strong resume: You can have a general resume that highlights your top skills and careers, but if you are entering a new industry, change your resume to meet their lingo and use the company’s language from the description.

Have your 90–180 second pitch ready: Have a solid, chronological story of your recent years and work ready to go. It became second nature to me after a few times and it definitely impressed people.

Utilize your network: Warm introductions are everything in Silicon Valley. When a person that is trusted introduces you, there is a higher chance person you wish to speak with take the time to chat.

Research the company: Before every call I researched the company on CrunchBase, the person I was talking to on LinkedIn, and any recent press. Be knowledgeable.

Talk to people at the company: Message them on LinkedIn, hop on a call, and do whatever it takes to learn more about the company — and now you have a reference if you do well.

Your resume is the foot in the door: Once you use your resume to understand what career to go after, you will complete phone screens and on-sites where you cover your experience. Make sure it relates to the position! I mention this again because your resume is the base and your conversations and ability to perform are what will get you hired.

Never make a cover letter: Cover letters are a waste of time. If you network your way in all you need is a resume. If you want to apply through a job portal and compete with thousands of applicants and waste your time, be my guest.

Keep relationships warm and stay in touch: Do not talk to someone one time, gain value, and never talk to them again. Find ways to create value for the other party and frequently stay in touch. Even if it is a “Hey, was thinking of you and hope you are well” or sending them an article they might be interested in.

Shorties:

- Faces are easier to remember than names
- Always go after a warm introduction into a company
- Be a hustler. Never give up. Find a way. Be persistent and patient.
- Provide real value to the people you talk to. In Silicon Valley value creation is crucial. Prove your worth and show what you can do.
- Always follow-up to say thank you after every conversation!

Recap:

- Network. Network. Network. Get warm introductions to firms, show your value, be persistent, and always follow-up. I will never apply through a job portal again. I have a strong network and will continue to grow it! If I do not know someone, I will find someone that knows that person! Keep pushing forward and you will get a job!

## How you can land a coding job with very little experience

### Find a good gig marketplace that fits your situation

You want to start your gig search by finding a ‘marketplace’ where employers will see you as a good solution to the problems they’re trying to solve. They typically look online in a ‘marketplace’: job board, mailing list, slack channel, forums, and so on. When I say ‘marketplace’ I really mean any community where a particular group of people post jobs.

Finding the proper marketplace is probably the most important part of doing a job search, and many people don’t approach the where of their job search very strategically.

If you spend time hunting on the wrong kind of marketplace, you’ll have a really tough time getting work. So it really pays to spend some time looking around for appropriate marketplaces.

First it goes without saying: look for a gig-focused marketplace. This likely means a place where entrepreneurial employers are posting small focused projects. This means you’ll want to avoid full-time job boards. Any post where you’d need to submit a resume and go through rounds of interviews is probably not what you are looking for.

In addition to looking for marketplaces that are ‘gig’ focused, you’ll have the most luck with marketplaces that are ‘niched’.

In an niched marketplace, the employers will be more relevant. You will face less competition than you would on a more general freelancing site. Most importantly niching gives you a chance to ‘stack the deck’ in your favor as you will be applying with an advantage over the competition even if that advantage is only ‘we live in the same city’.

If I had to start gigging again today, some places I might look include:

- craigslist (the gigs section) — it’s local / geographically focused, so you have some of the above-mentioned built-in advantages.
- in person physical meetups — again local and niched. In my experience, when you show up at these events, there is almost always someone looking for someone to help with their projects. The fact that you’re a local is a huge advantage.
- public-entrepreneur-focused slack chat groups and topical mailing lists (again they’re niched and a little less main-stream). You can find these by googling ‘public slack channels’— many of these have a specific section devoted to jobs, and most of the jobs on entrepreneur-focused channels will be gig-based.

### Apply for the gig

Applying for a gig is pretty simple. You will be having a conversation with an employer and you want to convince them that you can solve their problem.

Usually you will be sending an email. In some cases you might be filling in a form or something. It doesn’t really matter though as long as you can somehow have a conversation.

You want to let the employer know that you understand the problem that they’re trying to solve and that you think you can solve it for them.

You want to tell them how long you think it will take and include a little bit of information about yourself that explains why you specifically are a good match.

You want to include a few links to some pieces of work you have done that are similar to what the employer is looking for if you have them.

### Follow up

Following up is really important.

Think about it from an employers perspective (I know because I’ve hired people before).

You (as the employer) post a gig and start to receive messages from contractors. Many messages are terrible. The messages are poorly written or the contractor wants too much money or it doesn’t seem like the contractor understands what you want. A few applicants look promising but naturally you want to wait a bit for more applications to come in. Maybe someone spectacular will show up.

Eventually you move on to some other task and forget about the gig you posted. A few days go by and the applications stop showing up. You’re busy… and then you receive a follow-up email from one of the few promising applicants. This person seemed like they could get the job done and they seem professional (after all they followed up). Your decision is made.

As the contractor you want to be that person that looks promising and follows up. You would be surprised how few people follow-up when applying for gigs. It really does make all the difference.

After you send your initial email you wait a day or two and then send a quick email saying:

`Hey, I hadn’t heard back from you and thought I’d follow up. Have you found someone to help you out with your gig? If you’re still in need I am still available.`

In my experience this is when you get the job. Give it a try and see if it works for you.

### Don’t be discouraged

Getting gigs can be a bit of a numbers game at first. Don’t take rejection personally. In the beginning you won’t have built a reputation, so it’s only natural that people will be wary to hire you.

Keep on applying to postings and don’t be discouraged! I recommend thinking of success as ‘applying’ instead of actually ‘getting’ the job. It will help keep things in perspective. Eventually you will land your first gig.

That first gig you get is well worth the effort. After that first gig when someone asks you what you do for a living you will have something new to say to them:
