# How The Web Works

Last Update: 2019/08/14

## Basics

- Request-Response-Cycle
- Client <=> Server
- Request: Client asks Server for resource
- Response: Server serves resource to Client
- Communication Protocol: HTTP, HTTPS
- Languages of Server: JavaScript, PHP, Python
- Languages of Website: HTML (content), CSS (styling), JavaScript (interaction)

## Example: User wants to see Website

- User <=> Browser (Client) <=> Website (Server)
- User types in human-readable domain (e.g. https://www.google.com)
- Browser gets machine-readable address of Server by asking a Domain Name System (DNS) Server, that translates domain into IP address (e.g. 172.217.22.4)
- Website code gets served by Server
- Website code is already stored on the Server or is generated on-demand by the Server (static vs. dynamic Website)
- Website code gets interpreted in the Browser
- User can see interpreted Website code in the Browser
