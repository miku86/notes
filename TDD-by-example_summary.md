# Test-Driven Development By Example

## Random Thoughts

Another mental picture—programming is like exploring a dark house. You go from room to room to room. Writing the test is like turning on the light. Then you can avoid the furniture and save your shins (the clean design resulting from refactoring). Then you’re ready to explore the next room.

Make it run, make it right, make it fast.
