# Docker

## What problem does Docker solve?

Most people use an operating system like Windows, MacOS or Linux.
Furthermore, some people have installed runtimes, libraries and databases like Python, NodeJS, Ruby, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.

**Short**: We all have very different systems in use.

**Problem**: It is tedious to setup working environments, that fulfill all needed runtimes and dependencies to run a specific application.
Moreover, after working with this specific application, it is tedious to clean up the polluted environment.
A lot of orphaned runtimes and dependencies get accumulated.

**Solution**: Docker saves you the stress by isolating your application and its dependencies into a single self-contained unit that can reliably run anywhere.
